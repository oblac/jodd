> Produce lightweight code and focus on unleashing your full potential. Jodd is a set of developer-friendly and open-source Java micro-frameworks. It's designed to make things simple, but not simpler.

## 👋 Hello!

Welcome to the **Jodd** - a unique, alternative world of Java :) You can find here some micro-frameworks and some handy tools. Nothing more, nothing less.

## ‼️ The Future and Jodd Versions

Version **v6** is the maintained version, working on Java 8 and 11. Only few components are promoted to v6:

+ [jodd-util](https://github.com/oblac/jodd-util) ⭐
+ [jodd-mail](https://github.com/oblac/jodd-mail) ⭐
+ [jodd-json](https://github.com/oblac/jodd-json) ⭐
+ [jodd-lagarto](https://github.com/oblac/jodd-lagarto) ⭐
+ [jodd-http](https://github.com/oblac/jodd-http) ⭐
+ [jodd-props](https://github.com/oblac/jodd-props) ⭐

The decision which component is promoted is based on the Maven Central Repo statistics. 

Version **v5** contains remaining libraries and frameworks. They are in maintenance mode.

Sorry, I can only do so much.
