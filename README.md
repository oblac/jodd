# :zap: Jodd

**Jodd** is set of micro-frameworks and developer-friendly tools and utilities.

_Use what you like._

**Cool libraries**:

+ `jodd-json` - JSON parser and serializer.
+ `jodd-lagarto` - HTML parser with `Jerry` and `CSSelly` and `Form` tag.
+ `jodd-http` - tiny HTTP client.
+ `jodd-mail` - for easier email sending.

**Micro-frameworks**:

+ `jodd-madvoc` - slick MVC framework.
+ `jodd-petite` - pragmatic DI container.
+ `jodd-proxetta` - dynamic proxies and `Paramo`.
+ `jodd-db` - thin database layer and object mapper.
+ `jodd-jtx` - transactions management.

**Less used tools**:

+ `jodd-decora` - pages decorator.
+ `jodd-htmlstapler` - static page resources handler.
+ `jodd-vtor` - validation framework.

**Full Stack Bundle**:

+ `jodd-joy` - super-easy app framework, built with *Jodd* micro-frameworks.

**Utilities**:

+ `jodd-core` - contains many every-day utilities.
+ `jodd-bean` - our infamous `BeanUtil`, type inspectors and converters.
+ `jodd-props` - is the super-replacement for Java `Properties`.
+ `jodd-servlet` - with many servlet utilities, including nice tag library.

Read more in our [official documentation](http://jodd.org/doc).

## :octocat: Building Jodd from source

**Jodd** is built with [Gradle](http://gradle.org/) on JDK8,
targeting Java 1.8. You don't have to install anything,
the only prerequisites are [Git](http://help.github.com/set-up-git-redirect)
and Java JDK.

### Check out sources

Simply clone **Jodd** Git repo:

    git clone https://github.com/oblac/jodd.git jodd

### Compile and test, build jars

You can build the Jodd project with:

    gradlew build

This will build all jars and run all unit tests.
To skip the tests (for faster build), execute:

    gradlew build -x test

### Build full release with reports

To generate _full release_, including running integration tests and generating various reports,
you need [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) v1.12+.

	docker-compose -f etc/docker-compose.yml up
    gradlew clean release

Integration tests requires some infrastructure (like databases), hence Docker is
used.

### Install Jodd into your local Maven

    gradlew install

## :gift_heart: Contribute

Feel free to [contribute](CONTRIBUTING.md)! Follow these steps:

First time only:

+ fork the **Jodd** repo (`upstream`) to your GitHub account (`origin`)
+ clone `origin` as your `local` repo
+ install the [ZenHub](https://www.zenhub.com) plugin to track tasks

Every other time:

+ update both `origin` and `local` repos from `upstream`
+ create new branch for a feature or bug fix
+ commit often :)
+ once when work is done, push local changes to your `origin`
+ send us a pull request (PR)

We will pickup up from there :)
